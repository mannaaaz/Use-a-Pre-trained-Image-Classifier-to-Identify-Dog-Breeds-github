Image Classification for a City Dog Show
Project Goal
Improving your programming skills using Python.
In this project, you will use a created image classifier to identify dog breeds. We ask you to focus on Python and not on the actual classifier.

Description:
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.

You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs.

Program Outline
Time your program
Use Time Module to compute program runtime
Get program Inputs from the user
Use command line arguments to get user inputs
Create Pet Images Labels
Use the pet images filenames to create labels
Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
Use the Classifier function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
Calculate the Results
Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
Print the Results
You will need to repeat these tasks for each of the three image classification algorithms that are provided to you.
